## Project overview
A generic forum app you can find anywhere on the internet.

The goal of this project is in all the learning that happens in the process of building this app. This effort will cement my understanding of web technologies I gained from courses I've taken in the past, experiment and familiarize myself with other commonly used technologies to further hone my skills.

## Technologies involved:
- Frontend framework: React (Plan to start in the near future...)
- Backend web app framework: Flask, Gunicorn (hopefully)
- Dependency management: pipenv
- Testing: pytest
- CI: CircleCI
