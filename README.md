## Project overview
A generic forum app you can find anywhere on the internet.

This is my first attempt to build a non-trivial web app.
The goal I set for myself building this app is as follows:
- Cement my understanding of web technologies I already know. Just knowing is not enough; practice makes perfect.
- Experiment and familiarize myself with other commonly used technologies. Get in the habit of keeping my mind open to industry standards and best practices.

## Technologies
### Implemented
- Backend web app framework: Flask
- Dependency management / task runner: pipenv, npm
- Backend testing: pytest
- CI: CircleCI
- Persistent storage: mongoDB, Amazon S3
- Frontend framework: React
- Frontend testing: node.js + Jest + testing-library

### Planning to implement
- HTTP server/proxy: Gunicorn, Nginx
- CD: CircleCI
- Hosting: AWS/docker
