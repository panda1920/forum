## Project overview
A generic forum app you can find anywhere on the internet.

This is my first attempt to build a non-trivial web-app.
The goal I set for myself building this app is as follows:
- Cement my understanding of web technologies I already know. Just knowning is not enough.
- Experiment and familiarize myself with other commonly used technologies.

## Technologies currently being used
- Backend web app framework: Flask
- Dependency management / task runner: pipenv, npm

- CI: CircleCI
- Persistent storage: mongoDB, Amazon S3
- Frontend framework: React

- HTTP server/proxy: Gunicorn, Nginx
- CD: CircleCI
- Hosting: AWS/docker

## Features
