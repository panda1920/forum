        - Figure out how to make SSL connection from backend to DB

        - Better logging: place logging output for each files
        - Sanitize content of user posts
        - Setup better validation for other user inputs (max length of displayName etc.)
        - Setup route to upload images
        - Change interface to communicate errors in responses so that
            multiple errors can be registered

    [Frontend]
        - Separate dockerfile for prod/dev in client
            Create separate nginx conf for each
            Make sure docker-compose uses the dev dockerfile
        - Implement image upload functionality
        - Change the way search filters are passed to querystring
            want to specify operators like gt and lte in querystring

    [Deployment]
        - Deploy on amazon

    [Small things I need to work on]
        - Make optimizations to EntityList
            current implementation makes search calls twice when pager callback is triggered
            once when offset changes,
            second time when search result is returned
        - Fix issue where date is being converted to UTC time, not local time
        - Create thread button should not appear in BoardPage when not logged in
        - Client side validation during thread creation
